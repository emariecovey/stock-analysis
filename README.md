# Stock Analysis

## Overview of the Project
This project is for Steve, who is analyzing 12 green energy stocks' performance to help his parents diversify their investment portfolio. Code in the green_stocks.xlsm file is the original code, and code in the VBA_Challenge.xlsm code is refractored. 

## Results
### 2017 vs 2018 Stock performance 
Stocks in 2017 performed better than stocks in 2018. 
- In 2017, all but one stock (Ticker TERP) had a positive return.
- In 2018, only two stocks (Tickers ENPH and RUN) had positive returns. 
- Total daily volume was higher in 2018 ($3,306,038,200.00) than in 2017 ($3,166,639,100.00). 

### 2017 vs 2018 execution times
-
ticker volume, start price and end price variable not in array before? ticker index (makes it so you can have more flexibility?)
as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
analysis is described by screenshots and code

## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refractoring Code
- Advantages:
  - Code could be made to run quicker/more efficiently
  - Code could become more "future proof" so that if you added/changed data, the code would still work
  - In this example, the refractored VBA code had the advantage of making the volume, start price, and end price into arrays. This __________________________ how it actually helped
- Disadvantages:
  - Code could become "broken" if too many changes are made and errors not corrected
  - Code may not actually run faster or be more efficient, depending on the original code and how it is refractored
  - In this example, the refractored VBA code did not actually run more quickly.
